      The Group module allows you to create arbitrary collections of your content and
      users on your site and grant access control permissions on those collections

      Group also allows you to create communities. Users of the site can become
      members of a Group. You can then decide what membership of a Group entitles them to,
      such as access to content only available to members of that Group.
      There can also be different levels of membership to a Group so, for example, you can have
      administrative members who can create content and basic members who can only
      view content within the Group.
